Website Scope — Compliance as a Service (v1)
Objective

Create a simple, trust-first website that:

Explains the value of Compliance as a Service

Reassures users around risk and liability

Funnels visitors into a frictionless onboarding flow

Does not overclaim AI or insurance

Primary outcome:
👉 User starts onboarding (“Check your building”)

Pages & Routes
1️⃣ Home (/)

Purpose: Trust + clarity + action

Sections:

Hero (outcome-focused headline + CTA)

Problem (missed compliance, liability, admin burden)

Solution (3-step explanation)

Why it works (AI + human sign-off)

Who it’s for (Freeholders, RTMs, landlords, agents)

Risk & reassurance (liability, PI, audit trail)

Primary CTA: “Check your building”

2️⃣ How It Works (/how-it-works)

Purpose: Reduce uncertainty before onboarding

Content:

Upload what you have (any documents)

We build a compliance profile

You get a live 2-year compliance timeline

We keep it up to date and audit-ready

Include:

What AI does vs humans

What happens if docs are missing

What “green / amber / red” means

CTA repeated: “Check your building”

3️⃣ Who It’s For (/who)

Purpose: Let users self-identify quickly

Sections for:

Freeholders

RTMs / RMCs

Landlords (single or portfolio)

Managing agents

Each section answers:

Why compliance is hard for them

What this removes from their plate

No deep features.

4️⃣ Compliance Coverage (/coverage)

Purpose: Credibility, not exhaustiveness

High-level categories only:

Fire safety

Electrical

Water hygiene

Lifts

Emergency lighting

Asbestos (where applicable)

Explicit note:

Coverage depends on building type, height, and use — assessed during onboarding.

5️⃣ Risk & Liability (/risk)

Purpose: De-risk buying decision

Clearly state:

Legal liability remains with duty holder

Platform manages compliance process end-to-end

Human sign-off on outputs

Professional indemnity in place

Full audit trail and evidence retention
