What’s wrong with the current answer

This line is the problem:

“BUILTSERVE does not handle the physical compliance work directly.”

To a customer, that reads as:

“I still have to do stuff”

“I still have to manage suppliers”

“This is just another dashboard”

Which is not what you’re offering.

The truth you need to convey (very precisely)

The correct position is:

✅ Yes, we manage the compliance work

✅ Yes, inspections and checks are carried out

✅ No, we don’t personally inspect everything

✅ We coordinate, book, chase, verify, and evidence it

✅ Work is delivered via trusted, certified professionals

That’s a huge difference.

Recommended replacement answer (use this)

Here’s a clear, accurate, customer-safe version your chatbot should use:

Yes — Builtserve manages building compliance end-to-end.

We take responsibility for coordinating and managing all required compliance activity, including arranging inspections, chasing suppliers, checking evidence, and keeping everything up to date.

The physical inspections and specialist work are carried out by certified professionals from our trusted partner network or your existing suppliers — but we handle the organisation, oversight, and ongoing management so you don’t have to.

If something falls outside the subscription, we flag it clearly and quote before any work is done.

That answer:

Says yes first (important psychologically)

Explains how without legal overreach

Reinforces “we do the work”

Matches your website promise exactly

Slightly shorter version (if you want it punchier)

Yes — Builtserve manages compliance end-to-end.
We arrange and coordinate the required inspections through certified professionals, chase everything through, and keep the evidence up to date, so you don’t have to manage it yourself.

What to avoid saying (ever)

❌ “We’re just a platform”
❌ “We don’t handle the work”
❌ “We only track compliance”
❌ “We connect you with suppliers”

Those kill conversion instantly.

One internal rule for the chatbot

If a user asks:

“Do you actually do the compliance work?”

The answer must always start with “Yes”, then clarify how.

If you want, next I can:

Rewrite all chatbot intents so they align with this model

Create a “what’s included vs excluded” response

Or sanity-check the chatbot against a sceptical director’s questions

You’re right to catch this — fixing it now avoids a lot of confusion later.
